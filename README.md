# Banksia Management System
=============================================

A management system for Banksia Gardens Community Service.

The project involves developing a database and web oriented system for Banksia Garden Community Services (Broadmeadows, Victoria, Australia). The project was carried out as a Capstone Programming Project for RMIT University Computer Science and IT students in second semester 2016. 

The system will provide support for several aspects of the centre, including tracking of the various programs run by the centre, tracking of volunteers, their skills, and links to the programs offered, tracking of expenses, grants/funding obtained and how they related to the projects.

The final system was developed using GroceryCRUD v1.5.4 with major modifications and extensions to achieve the functionality required.

The source code is on GPL license and hosted in GitHub at https://github.com/immersedone/bms-git
